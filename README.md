# CopyDirectory
Program to copy a source file or entire folder into a destination directory

The File Copier is split between two Visual Studio Projects:

CopyDirectory - is the copy function itself, and can be used independently of the GUI. The executable file "CopyDirectory" runs this program in the command line
CopyDirectoryGUI - is a GUI for the copier. Please run the executable file "CopyDirectoryGUI" to view my full program
