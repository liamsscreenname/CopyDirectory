Please find in this Zip file the source code for my file copier, split between two Visual Studio Projects:

CopyDirectory - is the copy function itself, and can be used independently of the GUI. The executable file "CopyDirectory" runs this program in the command line
CopyDirectoryGUI - is a GUI for the copier. Please run the executable file "CopyDirectoryGUI" to view my full program
